# Anti_Cyber_Bullying-API
Created a REST API used to detect and avoid abusive contents/comments/posts on various social media and chatting platforms.
* Built a Machine Learning Model (Random Forest Classifier) and used NLTK library in Python to identify abusive content.
* Used Flask to create REST API for our model.
* Built a simple chatting app using Android Studio and Firebase Realtime Database to demonstrate the application and use of our API.
